<h3><i class="waste">Electronic Waste</i> is when electronic products that have come towards the end of their “useful life.” Many electronics products found around your office can be recycled like computers, laptops, copiers, printers, cell phones and many more products. Electronic waste has detrimental effects on our environment, the health of humans and animals and the risk of having your data stolen is raised. </h3>

<h1>5 Reasons Why E-Waste Is A Problem</h1>

<h2>Electronic waste keeps growing and growing</h2>
<p>Today people are buying more and more electronic devices and the electronic devices are being retired faster. For example, cell phones usually have a useful life of 18 to 24 months. In 2012,the average U.S. household spent $1,312 on consumer electronic products a year, according to a study by the Consumer Electronic Associations (CEA). More than 20 million tons of e-waste are produced every year.</p>


<h2>Environmental effects of e-waste</h2>
<p>The toxic materials from electronic devices are released into bodies of water, groundwater, soil and air, affecting both land and sea animals. When you throw out your e-waste they wind up in landfills, causing toxic materials to seep into groundwater. When e-waste is warmed up, toxic chemicals are released into the air damaging the atmosphere.</p>


<h2>Tons e-waste is shipped overseas</h2>
<p>Much of this left in junkyard to polluted the environment or burned for scrap by kids. Informal recycling markets in China, India, Pakistan,Vietnam, and Philippines handle anywhere from 50 percent to 80 percent of the world’s e-waste. In Guiyu, China, one of the largest electronic waste landfill sites in the world. When electronic devices are dumped in these developing countries the impact is detrimental to the environment of the country and the health of the people.</p>


<h2>Health implications of electronic waste</h2>
<p>Computers and most electronics contain toxic materials such as lead, zinc, nickel,barium and chromium, specifically with lead, if released is not the environment can cause damage to human blood, kidneys, as well as central and peripheral nervous systems. Residents of Guiyu, China exhibit substantial digestive, neurological, respiratory and bone problems.The impact of electronic waste is detrimental to the health of the people in these developing countries.</p>


<h2>Electronic waste and data security</h2>

These are just a few of the problems that can be cause by not properly disposing of your electronic waste due to people stealing information from the hard drives in e-waste.</p>





<h1>Why do we have to recycle electronic waste?</h1>

<h3>Many old electronic devices contain toxic substances that include lead, mercury, cadmium, beryllium, polyvinyl chloride, and chromium. When e-waste is tossed into landfills, these chemicals leach into the soil, polluting the ground water as well as the air.</h3>
<br>

<h3>Electronics are made of components that contain valuable raw materials. Recycling old devices saves energy. It also means that fewer raw materials need to be drawn from nature to create new devices.</h3>
<br>

<h3>Reusing old devices prevents e-waste by keeping it out of landfills. It also saves the resources used to recycle them. Additionally, reusing electronics helps other, less-fortunate people in your community. So take your old devices to be refurbished (if possible) and give them a new life.</h3>
<br>

<h3>Recycling saves the raw materials that can be repurposed by producing new devices. As a result, energy is saved, pollution is reduced, and there are fewer greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere.</h3>
