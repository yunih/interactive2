<div class="revealer" id="plasticBox">
	<h3>Plastic</h3>
	<p class="health">Exposure to them is linked to cancers, birth defects, impaired immunity, endocrine disruption and other ailments.
	</p>
	<p class="environment">Plastic debris, laced with chemicals and often ingested by marine animals, can injure or poison wildlife. Plastic buried deep in landfills can leach harmful chemicals that spread into groundwater.
	</p>
</div>


<div class="revealer right" id="cooperBox">
	<h3>Copper</h3>
	<p class="health">Long-term exposure to copper dust can irritate your nose, mouth, and eyes, and cause headaches, dizziness, nausea, and diarrhea. Intentionally high intakes of copper can cause liver and kidney damage and even death.
	</p>
	<p class="environment">When copper ends up in soil it strongly attaches to organic matter and minerals. In surface water copper can travel great distances, either suspended on sludge particles or as free ions.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="revealer" id="goldBox">
	<h3>Gold</h3>
	<p class="health">Gold is used to cure rheumatoid arthritis, under a treatment called Chrysotherapy. It is prescribed when treatment with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs is failing to give relief. Inhalation may cause irritation if exposure is prolonged or excessive. Skin may irritation and allergic reaction and eyes may irritation.
	</p>
	<p class="environment">Gold has not been evaluated for its ecotoxicity. However, the biodegradation of gold under aerobic conditions is expected to be very poor and there is no evidence to suggest it creates ecological problems when released into the environment. 
	</p>
</div>

<div class="revealer right" id="leadBox">
	<h3>Lead</h3>
	<p class="health">Disruption of the biosynthesis of haemoglobin and anaemia and rise blood pressure, kidney damage, miscarriages and subtle abortions, disruption of nervous systems, brain damage, declined fertility of men through sperm damage, diminished learning abilities of children
	</p>
	<p class="environment">Soil functions are disturbed by lead intervention, especially near highways and farmlands, where extreme concentrations may be present. Soil organisms than suffer from lead poisoning, too.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="revealer" id="zincBox">
	<h3>Zinc</h3>
	<p class="health">Although humans can handle proportionally large concentrations of zinc, too much zinc can still cause eminent health problems, such as stomach cramps, skin irritations, vomiting, nausea and anemia. Very high levels of zinc can damage the pancreas and disturb the protein metabolism and cause arteriosclerosis. 
	</p>
	<p class="environment">Zinc can interrupt the activity in soils, as it negatively influences the activity of microrganisms and earthworms.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="revealer right" id="berylliumBox">
	<h3>Beryllium</h3>
	<p class="health">Beryllium can also cause allergic reactions with people that are hypersensitive to this chemical. These reactions can be very heavy and they can even cause a person to be seriously ill, a condition known as Chronic Beryllium Disease (CBD). The symptoms are weakness, tiredness and breathing problems. Some people that suffer from CBD will develop anorexia and blueness of hands and feet. Sometimes people can even be in such a serious condition that CBD can cause their death.
	</p>
	<p class="environment">Beryllium as a chemical element occurs naturally in soils in small amounts, but human activities have also increased these beryllium levels. Beryllium is not likely to move deeper into the soil and dissolve within groundwater.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="revealer" id="tantalumBox">
	<h3>Tantalum</h3>
	<p class="health">May be harmful by inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption and eye and skin irritation. Material is irritating to mucous membranes and upper respiratory tract. 
	</p>
	<p class="environment">Do not allow material to be released to the environment without proper governmental permits. Isolate runoff of tantalum oxide to prevent environmental pollution.
	</p>
</div>
