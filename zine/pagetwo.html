	<h3>Lead</h3>
	<p>Disruption of the biosynthesis of haemoglobin and anaemia
- A rise in blood pressure
- Kidney damage
- Miscarriages and subtle abortions
- Disruption of nervous systems
- Brain damage
- Declined fertility of men through sperm damage
- Diminished learning abilities of children
- Behavioural disruptions of children, such as aggression, impulsive behavior and hyperactivity
		<br><br>
		Soil functions are disturbed by lead intervention, especially near highways and farmlands, where extreme concentrations may be present. Soil organisms than suffer from lead poisoning, too.

Lead is a particularly dangerous chemical, as it can accumulate in individual organisms, but also in entire food chains.

	<h3>Mercury	</h3>
	<p>Found in fluorescent tubes (numerous applications), tilt switches (mechanical doorbells, thermostats), and ccfl backlights in flat screen monitors.
		<br><br>
		Health effects include sensory impairment, dermatitis, memory loss, and muscle weakness. Exposure in-utero causes fetal deficits in motor function, attention, and verbal domains. Environmental effects in animals include death, reduced fertility, and slower growth and development.

<div class="revealer right" id="plasticBox">
	<h3>Plastic</h3>
	<p>Toxic chemicals leach out of plastic and are found in the blood and tissue of nearly all of us. Exposure to them is linked to cancers, birth defects, impaired immunity, endocrine disruption and other ailments.
		<br><br>
		Plastic debris, laced with chemicals and often ingested by marine animals, can injure or poison wildlife. Plastic buried deep in landfills can leach harmful chemicals that spread into groundwater.
