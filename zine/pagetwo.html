	<h3>Plastic</h3>
	<p class="health">Human - Exposure to them is linked to cancers, birth defects, impaired immunity, endocrine disruption and other ailments.
	</p>
	<p class="environment">Environment - Plastic debris, laced with chemicals and often ingested by marine animals, can injure or poison wildlife. Plastic buried deep in landfills can leach harmful chemicals that spread into groundwater.

<div class="revealer right" id="cooperBox">
	<h3>Copper</h3>
	<p class="health">Long-term exposure to copper dust can irritate your nose, mouth, and eyes, and cause headaches, dizziness, nausea, and diarrhea. Intentionally high intakes of copper can cause liver and kidney damage and even death.
	</p>
	<p class="environment">When copper ends up in soil it strongly attaches to organic matter and minerals. In surface water copper can travel great distances, either suspended on sludge particles or as free ions.

<div class="revealer" id="goldBox">
	<h3>Gold</h3>
	<p class="health">Gold is used to cure rheumatoid arthritis, under a treatment called Chrysotherapy. It is prescribed when treatment with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs is failing to give relief. Inhalation may cause irritation if exposure is prolonged or excessive. Skin may irritation and allergic reaction and eyes may irritation.
	</p>
	<p class="environment">Gold has not been evaluated for its ecotoxicity. However, the biodegradation of gold under aerobic conditions is expected to be very poor and there is no evidence to suggest it creates ecological problems when released into the environment.

<div class="revealer right" id="leadBox">
	<h3>Lead</h3>
	<p class="health">Disruption of the biosynthesis of haemoglobin and anaemia and rise blood pressure, kidney damage, miscarriages and subtle abortions, disruption of nervous systems, brain damage, declined fertility of men through sperm damage, diminished learning abilities of children
	</p>
	<p class="environment">Soil functions are disturbed by lead intervention, especially near highways and farmlands, where extreme concentrations may be present. Soil organisms than suffer from lead poisoning, too.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="revealer" id="zincBox">
	<h3>Zinc</h3>
	<p class="health">Although humans can handle proportionally large concentrations of zinc, too much zinc can still cause eminent health problems, such as stomach cramps, skin irritations, vomiting, nausea and anemia. Very high levels of zinc can damage the pancreas and disturb the protein metabolism and cause arteriosclerosis. 
	</p>
	<p class="environment">Zinc can interrupt the activity in soils, as it negatively influences the activity of microrganisms and earthworms.

	<h3>Americium</h3>
	<p>The radioactive source in smoke alarms.

<div class="revealer right" id="leadBox">
	<h3>Lead</h3>
	<p>Disruption of the biosynthesis of haemoglobin and anaemia
- A rise in blood pressure
- Kidney damage
- Miscarriages and subtle abortions
- Disruption of nervous systems
- Brain damage
- Declined fertility of men through sperm damage
- Diminished learning abilities of children
- Behavioural disruptions of children, such as aggression, impulsive behavior and hyperactivity
		<br><br>
		Soil functions are disturbed by lead intervention, especially near highways and farmlands, where extreme concentrations may be present. Soil organisms than suffer from lead poisoning, too.

Lead is a particularly dangerous chemical, as it can accumulate in individual organisms, but also in entire food chains.

	<h3>Mercury	</h3>
	<p>Found in fluorescent tubes (numerous applications), tilt switches (mechanical doorbells, thermostats), and ccfl backlights in flat screen monitors.
		<br><br>
		Health effects include sensory impairment, dermatitis, memory loss, and muscle weakness. Exposure in-utero causes fetal deficits in motor function, attention, and verbal domains. Environmental effects in animals include death, reduced fertility, and slower growth and development.
	</p>

<div class="revealer right" id="plasticBox">
	<h3>Plastic</h3>
	<p>Toxic chemicals leach out of plastic and are found in the blood and tissue of nearly all of us. Exposure to them is linked to cancers, birth defects, impaired immunity, endocrine disruption and other ailments.
		<br><br>
		Plastic debris, laced with chemicals and often ingested by marine animals, can injure or poison wildlife. Plastic buried deep in landfills can leach harmful chemicals that spread into groundwater.
